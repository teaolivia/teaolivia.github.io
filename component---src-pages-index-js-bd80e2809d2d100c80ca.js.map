I also accept short-term projects as I am currently doing my e-advertising project with Django and AWS Lambda for its backend and React.js for its frontend. I also design its REST API with AWS API Gateway and store them in NoSQL form in AWS DynamoDB, due June 15th 2019. Mainly doing backend but open to do other things at certain and each have different tolerance. Interested about product performance measuring with microservices design and scaling techniques.
